# Timesheet Overview

## What is a Timesheet?&#x20;

A [Timesheet](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/timesheet.md) is a record to capture time spent delivering services for a given [Resource](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/resource.md). This includes information about the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) or [Shift](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/shift.md) related to the service, any breaks taken, travel times where applicable, as well as any other information that must be reported.

[Timesheets](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/timesheet.md) are comprised of [Timesheet Entries](create-a-timesheet-entry.md). &#x20;

## What is a Timesheet Entry?&#x20;

[Timesheet Entries](create-a-timesheet-entry.md) are used to track the hours worked by a [Resource](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/resource.md) for a particular service within a particular Appointment as part of Maica. They can also be created manually for any additional requirements.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Timesheet Entries in Maica are automatically generated after an `Appointment` is `Completed`. This can be configured on a `Resource` record by setting the `Timesheet Management` dropdown to `Enabled` , or within your `Maica Settings`. To learn more, click here.&#x20;
