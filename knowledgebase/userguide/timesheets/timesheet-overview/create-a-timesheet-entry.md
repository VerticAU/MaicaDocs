# Create a Timesheet Entry

## How do I create a Timesheet Entry?

Although Timesheet Entries are automatically generated after an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md), you may also need to generate a manual entry for additional requirements. A quick and efficient way to create a Timesheet Entry is through the the **Timesheet Management** tab. Maica has an interactive user mechanism where you can simply drag and release your mouse on the calendar displayed in Timesheet Management in order to prompt the creation of a Timesheet Entry.&#x20;

Please see below for an example:&#x20;

You can also create a Timesheet Entry by clicking the `+` button when in the Timesheet Management tab. Creating a Timesheet Entry this way will pre-populate the `Date & Time` to the current `Date & Time`.&#x20;

## What does Creating a Timesheet Entry include?

Once you have created a Timesheet Entry, and the pop-up is displaying, a few fields must be populated before the Entry can be confirmed. These include:

### 1. Date & Time&#x20;

**Maica** will automatically pre-populate the Date & Time of your Timesheet Entry based on the Calendar. If you wish to change the Date & Time, you can do so manually. You can also adjust your Timesheet Entry to configure it by `Duration`, you do so by simply clicking the `Duration (mins)` link in the Date & Time section of the Entry, as shown below.&#x20;

### 2. Activity&#x20;

In the next section of the Timesheet Entry, **Maica** will prompt you to add an Activity. This is anything that has been done during the Time of the Entry.&#x20;

If this is a repeated Activity, **Maica** also allows you to `Do this for every day at this time during the Timesheet Period`.  If this is toggled `On`, a seperate yet identical Timesheet Entry will be created for everyday within the Timesheet with the same information as the original entry.&#x20;

If the Activity added is configured to allow for an Expense Claim, you can do so by clicking the toggle. This toggle will only appear if a configured Activity is added to the Timesheet Entry; otherwise, it will not be visible.&#x20;

### 3. Notes&#x20;

This allows for custom text around the details of the Timesheet Entry.
