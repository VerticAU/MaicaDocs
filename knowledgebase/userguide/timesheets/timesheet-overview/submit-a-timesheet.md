# Submit a Timesheet

## How do I submit a Timesheet?

Once a [Timesheet](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/timesheet.md) has been populated with [Timesheet Entries](create-a-timesheet-entry.md) and is ready to be submitted, click the `Submit Button` in the top right corner of the screen, as shown below.

This will action submit your [Timesheet](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/timesheet.md) to the assigned Administrator for `Approval`.&#x20;
