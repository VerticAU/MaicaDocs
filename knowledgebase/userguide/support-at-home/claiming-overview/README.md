# Claiming Overview

## Claiming Overview

In Maica, the **Support at Home Claim Submission** process enables you to generate and submit claim batches to **Services Australia**, retrieve the status of your claims, and automatically update your invoices and budgets based on the response received.

***

## Purpose

The **Support at Home Claim Submission** process is designed to:

* Generate a **claim batch** for submission to **Services Australia** via API.
* Use a Quick Action to **check the claim status** after submission.
* **Update invoice and line item records** based on the claim’s final status (e.g., paid).
* Output **Payment Request records** in line with responses from Services Australia.
