# Additional Details

## What does the Additional Details stage include?

The Additional Details tab captures any extra details of the Appointment, as described in the below table:

<table><thead><tr><th width="222">Captured Information	</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/checklist.md">Checklist(s)</a></td><td>This allows for the selection of relevant organisational <a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/checklist.md">Checklist(s)</a> based on the tasks to be performed during the <a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md">Appointment</a>. <strong>Maica</strong> will automatically assign <a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/checklist.md">Checklist(s)</a> to your <a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md">Appointment</a> that are associated with the selected <a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment-service.md">Appointment Service(s)</a>   </td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/shift.md">Shift(s)</a></td><td>This allows for the ability to assign your <a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md">Appointment</a> to a <a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/shift.md">Shift(s)</a>. <strong>Maica</strong> will automatically assign <a href="../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/shift.md">Shift(s)</a> that occur at the same Location as the new appointment, as well as the same Date &#x26; Time.
