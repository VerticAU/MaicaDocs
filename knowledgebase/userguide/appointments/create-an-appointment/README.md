# Create an Appointment

## How do I create an Appointment?

A quick and efficient way to create [Appointments](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) is directly through the the Maica [Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md). Maica has an interactive user mechanism where you can simply drag and release your mouse on the [Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md) in order to prompt the creation of an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Creating an Appointment is dependant on what [View](../../the-planner/planner-views-and-modes/) you are in within the Planner. You need to be in one of `Schedule`, `Participant`, `Asset` or `Accomodation` View in order to create an Appointment, otherwise you will [create a Shift](../../shifts/create-a-shift/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Please see below for an example:&#x20;

You can also create an Appointment through the Planner Quick Action. To learn more, click [here](../../the-planner/planner-actions/create-new-appointment.md).&#x20;

## Pre-populated Fields

When creating an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md), a number of fields will be pre-populated. These fields depend on the [Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md) view the user is in when the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) is created. The pre-populated fields for each view are outlined in the table below:

<table><thead><tr><th width="215">Planner View</th><th>Pre-populated fields</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="schedule.md">Schedule</a></td><td><code>Start Date</code>, <code>Start Time</code>, <code>End Date</code>, <code>End Time</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../the-planner/planner-views-and-modes/participant-view.md">Participant View </a></td><td><code>Start Date</code>, <code>Start Time</code>, <code>End Date</code>, <code>End Time</code>, <code>Participant</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../the-planner/planner-views-and-modes/asset-view.md">Asset View </a></td><td><code>Start Date</code>, <code>Start Time</code>, <code>End Date</code>, <code>End Time</code>, <code>Asset</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../the-planner/planner-views-and-modes/accomodation-view.md">Accomodation View </a></td><td><code>Start Date</code>, <code>Start Time</code>, <code>End Date</code>,<code>End Time</code>, <code>Location</code>, <code>Accomodation</code></td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../the-planner/planner-views-and-modes/roster-view.md">Roster View </a></td><td>This view will create a <code>Shift</code> </td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../the-planner/planner-views-and-modes/shift-view.md">Shift View </a></td><td>This view will create a <code>Shift</code> </td></tr></tbody></table>

## Appointment Stages

After the new [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) is created, a few stages must be completed before the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) can be confirmed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The available sections during the creation or management of the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) are are configurable and determined by the selected [Appointment Services](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment-service.md) and the Maica Settings. For further information, see the Administration Guide.
{% endhint %}

Below is a list of these stages:

1. [Basic Details ](basic-details.md)
2. [Location](location.md)&#x20;
3. [Schedule](schedule.md)
4. [Additional Details](additional-details.md)&#x20;
5. [Custom Fields](custom-fields.md)&#x20;
6. [Summary](summary.md)&#x20;

To dive deeper into each stage, please visit the specific pages for detailed information on every stage.&#x20;
