# Google Maps

## What does the Google Maps Action do?&#x20;

The Google Maps action opens the directions to the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) from a number of selectable starting points in Google Maps, directly from the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md).&#x20;

## How do I use the Google Maps Action?&#x20;

To begin using the Google Maps Action, first open up the Appointment, then simply select the Google Maps button in the top right hand corner of the interface, as shown below.&#x20;

After clicking the Google Maps button, a dropdown menu will appear, allowing you to select a location from which to receive directions. There are the following options:

* `Home Address`
* `Primary Location`&#x20;
* `Current Location`&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to use `Current Location` to receive directions to your Appointment, Location must be allowed on your browser or device.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Following a selection of Location, a new tab will open in Google Maps with directions to your Appointment from your selected Location.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If a Resource has multiple Appointments on one day, they can access a route between all Appointment on Google Maps by using the handy action accessible in Schedule View on Timeline Mode. To learn more, click [here](../../the-planner/planner-views-and-modes/schedule.md#timeline-mode).&#x20;
