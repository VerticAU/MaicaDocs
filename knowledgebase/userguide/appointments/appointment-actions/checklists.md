# Checklists

## How do I access Appointment Checklist(s)?

To view your Appointment Checklist(s), simply open an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) and then click the `Checklist` button at the bottom of the screen to bring up the dialogue box. Once selected, you will see the allocated Checklist(s) to your Appointment grouped by Appointment Service.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You will only see Checklist Item(s) that are set to an execute status of `During` or `Either`. Any other Checklist Item(s) will be shown at either the [Check-In](check-in.md) or [Check-Out](check-out.md) stage.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Checklist Actions

### 1. Checklist Item Note

For each **Checklist Item,** if so configured in the [Checklist](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/checklist.md), you are prompted to provide further information to manage possible outcomes of **Checklist Items** in the form of a **Note**. You access this **Note** by simply clicking on each **Checklist Item.**
