# Appointment Breaks

## How do I record an Appointment Break?

To begin recording an Appointment Break, simply open an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) and then click the `Manage Appointment Breaks` button at the bottom of the screen to bring up the dialogue box.&#x20;

Once selected, you can create a new break by selecting the `+ New` button on the right hand side of the screen, as shown below.&#x20;

Once you have added a new Appointment Break, you will be prompted to populate a number of fields detailing the break. Here, you can assign the relevant Date & Time information, the relevant Resource(s), the break category and write custom notes.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to maintain the parameters of an Appointment, **Maica** will not allow you to create an Appointment Break outside the `Date` or `Time` of the Scheduled Appointment. You also must assign a `Category` in order to submit a Note.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Appointment Break Actions

### 1. Create Corresponding Timesheet&#x20;

Within an Appointment Break, you can choose to create a corresponding [Timesheet](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/timesheet.md). You do so by simply clicking the toggle, as shown below.&#x20;

If the [Timesheet](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/timesheet.md) is created, it must be assigned a Timesheet Activity.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The Break will be stored as an Unavailability record against the allocated Resource.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
