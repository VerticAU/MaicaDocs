# Attach Files

## How do I attach a file to an Appointment?&#x20;

To begin attaching a file, simply open an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) and then click the `Files` button at the bottom of the screen to bring up the dialogue box. Once selected, you can attach files to an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md). This includes the ability to take a photo, attach a PDF file, or upload any other allowed file type.
