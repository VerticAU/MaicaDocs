# Participant Notes

## How do I record a Participant Note(s)?

To begin recording a Participant Note(s), simply open an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) and then click the `Notes` button at the bottom of the screen to bring up the dialogue box.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note, this can also be accessed from the Appointment Quick Action box directly from the Planner, or from anywhere within **Maica** using the Client Note action from the Maica Global Actions menu.
{% endhint %}

Once selected, you can create a new note by selecting the `+` button in the top right corner of the screen, as shown below.&#x20;

Once a new Participant Note has been created, you will be prompted to populate a number of customisable fields.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to open and close the text input box, select the arrow on the far right hand side of the screen, as shown below.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This will open up the text input box for custom Note(s). Here, you can also add a Note Template, by clicking the button shown below.&#x20;

Click the `Blue Tick` in the upper corner to save your letter after you have filled in the required fields and entered your Note.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, this `Blue Tick` may also be a `Save` button depending on your Maica version. If you happen to click close without saving, you will be prompted with a confirmation message.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Use the "Create Note for All Participants"checkbox to create the same note for all Participants in the Appointment (except those with cancelled Delivery Activities).\
\
When selected, the Participant field is disabled, and a separate note is automatically created for each Participant.\
\
Each note appears in the modal after saving and can be edited individually.
{% endhint %}

Once a new Participant Note Task has been created, you will be prompted to populate a number of customisable fields, including assigning your task to the required personnel.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note: The Participant Note Section has been removed from the [Check In](check-in.md)/[Out](check-out.md) (and [Quick Complete](quick-completion.md)) flows due to issues determining the assignment of the Participant Note record while completing Appointments with multiple Participants.

Participant Notes can still be created at any stage in the Appointment lifecycle by selecting the Note quick action from the Manage Appointment module (which can be assigned to a specific Participant), or, from the [Participant Note Action](../../participants/global-actions/new-billable-participant-note.md) from the Maica Global Actions menu.
