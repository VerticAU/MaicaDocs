# Quick Completion

## What is Quick Completing an Appointment?&#x20;

Quick Completing an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) essentially bypasses the checking in/out processes and sets an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) to the `Completed` status. It is possible to still capture [Appointment Service](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment-service.md) information whilst Quick Completing an Appointment.

## What does the Quick Complete Action include?

When Quick Completing an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md), you are presented with a dialog showing distinct areas of input including **Appointment Date & Time Information**, **Appointment Service Information**, **Manage Travel** as well as **Check-In/Out Location**; these areas are further described in this article.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you wish to Quick Complete your Appointment without adjusting any of these areas, you can. **Maica** will automatically populate the required ones with information from the Appointment, hence, they only need to be manually adjusted if desired.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Check In/Out Location

This part of the Quick Complete process captures accurate Location information. **Maica** offers the ability for Locations to be tracked to ensure that [Appointments](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) can be accurately recorded.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In order for a Location to be obtained, the User must have Location Permissions set to Allowed on their Device or Browser.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Appointment Date & Time Information&#x20;

This part of the Quick Complete process captures the relevant Date & Time information. **Maica** offers configurable capability when Quickly Completing an Appointment to ensure that [Appointments](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) can be accurately recorded.&#x20;

When Quickly Completing your [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md), **Maica** will automatically populate the Date and Time information to the scheduled Date and Time of the Appointment. This can be configured by manually entering any desired Date and Time.

### Manage Travel&#x20;

When Quick Completing an Appointment, you can also Manage Travel. To learn more about the Manage Travel Action, please click here:&#x20;

2. [Manage Travel Logic for Administrators](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/system-processes/travel-claiming-and-expenses)

### Appointment Services&#x20;

This part of the process offers an overview of the [Appointment Service(s)](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment-service.md) delivered as well as the ability to adjust the quantity of each service as required. Adjusting the quantity offers you flexibility within an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) to control how long each [Participant](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/participant.md) may spend for each [Appointment Service](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment-service.md) within an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md), or how long each Service may have been delivered. This means, if the actual service duration has changed for one or more Participants, this can easily be captured.
