# Check-In

## What does the Check-In Action include?

When checking into an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md), you are presented with a dialog showing essentially three distinct areas of input including **Appointment Date Information**, **Resource(s) that are Checking In**, **Appointment Checklist Information** as well as **Check-In Location**; these areas are further described in this article.

## Appointment Date Information

This part of the Check-In process captures the relevant Date and Time information. **Maica** offers configurable capability for Check-In information to ensure that [Appointments](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) can be accurately recorded.&#x20;

When Checking-In to your [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md), **Maica** will automatically populate the Date and Time information to the current Date and Time. This can be configured by manually entering any desired Date and Time, or by setting the information directly to match the **Scheduled Appointment** by selecting the text shown below.

## Who is Checking-In?

This part of the Check-In process determines which [Resource(s)](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/resource.md) are Checking-In at any given time. When you check in to an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) for the first time, all of the [Resource(s)](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/resource.md) allocated to that [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) are automatically populated. This can be modified by manually removing any resources that are not currently Checking-In. To Check-In these [Resource(s)](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/resource.md) at a later time, simply reselect the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md), then Check-In, and repeat the process. All [Resource(s)](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/resource.md) assigned to the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) who have not already Checked-In will be automatically populated once again.

The status of the Appointment changes from `Scheduled` to `In Progress` after the first Resource(s) checks in.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Appointment Checklist Information

This part of the Check-In process captures any [Checklist(s)](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/checklist.md) assigned to the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md). If a [Checklist(s)](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/checklist.md) has been associated with an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md), you will be presented with the list of each Checklist Item and asked to capture the outcome of each item.

{% hint style="info" %}
This stage will only show Checklist Item(s) that are set to an execute status of `Before` or `Either`
{% endhint %}

For each **Checklist Item,** if so configured in the [Checklist](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/checklist.md), you are prompted to provide further information to manage possible outcomes of **Checklist Items** in the form of a **Note**. You access this **Note** by simply clicking on each **Checklist Item.**

## Check-In Location

This part of the Check-In process captures accurate Check-In Location information. **Maica** offers the ability for Check-In locations to be tracked to ensure that [Appointments](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) can be accurately recorded.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In order for a Location to be obtained, the User must have Location Permissions set to Allowed on their Device or Browser.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
