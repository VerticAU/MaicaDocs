# Expenses

### What Is the Expenses Action?

The Expenses action allows you to record any costs associated with an Appointment or Shift. These might include travel-related expenses, supplies, or other approved items as defined by your organisation.

### Creating an Expense

1. Tap the **Expenses** button from the Appointment or Shift actions menu.
2. Enter the required details:
   * **Date** of the expense
   * **Amount**
   * **Note** (optional, to provide more context)
3. Tap **Save** once the information is complete.

### Managing Expenses

After saving, your expense will appear in the **Expenses list** for that Appointment or Shift, showing the **Date** and **Amount**. From here you can:

* Reopen the expense entry to update it.
* **Edit** the details if needed.
* **Delete** the expense if it was added in error.

Just like with Notes, additional actions such as attaching files can only be done after the expense has been saved. To use these options, save the expense first, then re-enter it from the list.
