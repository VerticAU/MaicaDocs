# Check Out

## Starting the Check-Out Process

At the end of your Appointment or Shift, return to the overview screen and tap the **Check-Out** button. This opens the **Check-Out Summary**, which provides an overview of your Travel, Completed Services, and any required Check-Out Actions.

## Summary

### Travel Summary

The Travel Summary shows the **total distance travelled** and **total travel time** to and from your Appointment. These values are automatically calculated.

{% hint style="info" %}
Travel is calculated dynamically using Appointment locations and Google API data. To learn how to manage this information, please refer to the [Manage Travel](check-out.md#manage-travel) section below.
{% endhint %}

### Completed Services

This section displays the **Service(s)** during the Appointment or Shift.

## Check-Out Actions

### Manage Travel

Selecting **Manage Travel** opens a more detailed breakdown of the above Travel Summary. Here you will see information broken down into:

* **To Appointment** – Distance and duration from your starting point.
* **From Appointment** – Distance and duration from the Appointment to your next location.
* **Total** – Combined travel time and distance.

If the figures do not match your actual travel, you have two options:

1. **Edit and Save** – You can directly adjust the values by first clicking the `Edit` button shown at the bottom of the screen. When doing so, you may need to add a comment explaining the change, and resave. This will update the Appointment or Shift automatically.
2. **Contact Organisation** – If the edit button is not visible, you will need to notify your organisation to make corrections. We recommend using [Incidents](incidents.md) to do so.&#x20;

### Manage Expenses

The **Manage Expenses** option allows you to add any expenses that were not captured during the Appointment. This works in the same way as the [**Expenses Action**](expenses.md) on the Appointment screen, but is available here as a final step before Check-Out.

### Checklist Items

If your Appointment has **Checklist Items** relevant to Check-Out, you will be asked to complete them here. Each Checklist Item may require you to:

* Change its status (e.g. from “Not Started” to “Completed”).
* Enter notes if extra information is needed.

Checklist Items must be completed before you can finalise your Check-Out. As you finish each one, a green tick will appear to show it’s complete.&#x20;

### Participant Notes

If required (for example, for some NDIS Appointments), you may need to complete **mandatory Participant Notes** at Check-Out. These will be displayed under Check-Out Actions with a visual indicator to alert you of their completion status.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You also have the option to create **one note that applies to all participants**, if suitable.
{% endhint %}

Once all required items are ticked off, the **Check-Out** button at the bottom of the screen will activate.

## Finalising Check-Out

Once you have completed all required actions, press **Check-Out** to finalise. You will be returned to the Appointment or Shift overview screen, where the status will update to **Appointment Completed**.
