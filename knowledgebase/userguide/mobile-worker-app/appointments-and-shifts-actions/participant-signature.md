# Participant Signature

### What Is the Participant Signatures Action?

The Participant Signatures action allows you to capture a digital signature from a Participant, their guardian, or any authorised or required person.&#x20;

### How to Capture a Signature

1. Tap the **Participant Signatures** button from the Appointment or Shift actions menu.
2. A signature pad will open, where the Participant (or required person) can sign using their finger or a stylus.
3. Select the relevant **Participant** from the list of participants linked to the Appointment or Shift that this signature relates too.
4. Once the signature is complete, tap **Confirm** to save it.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Date and Time** field is automatically recorded as read-only. This ensures the exact time of signing is always captured and cannot be changed.
{% endhint %}

### Where Are Signatures Stored?

* Each signature is saved as a PNG file in the [**Files**](attach-files.md) area of the Appointment or Shift record.
* The file is automatically named `Signature – [Participant Name]` for easy reference.
* If you open the **Participant Signatures** action again, it will take you back to the signature pad for capturing new signatures. To view past signatures, you will need to open the saved file in **Files**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Signatures are stored as files and may be visible to others in your organisation with access permissions.
