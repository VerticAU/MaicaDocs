# Open

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is an administrative feature. The **Open** action is primarily intended for administrators or schedulers who need full access to the Salesforce Appointment or Shift record. Most care workers will not see or use this function in day-to-day work.
{% endhint %}

#### What does the Open Action include?

The **Open** action takes you out of the streamlined **Maica view** of the Appointment or Shift and into the underlying **Salesforce record**. From here, you can view and interact with the Appointment using Salesforce’s standard functionality.

This means you’ll no longer be in the mobile Maica experience, but instead working directly with the native Salesforce record.

#### Why use Open?

You would use **Open** if you need to:

* Access **related lists** connected to the Appointment (e.g. Timesheet Entries).
* Use full Salesforce features such as reporting or history tracking.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Maica covers everything you need to use.** It is designed so that no work needs to be done directly on the Salesforce record — but the record is still available if your organisation requires it or wants to reference it.&#x20;
