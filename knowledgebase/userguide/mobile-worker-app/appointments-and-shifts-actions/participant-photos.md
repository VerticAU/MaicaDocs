# Participant Photos

### What Are Participant Photos?

The Participant Photos action gives you a quick way to see any photos that have been uploaded and attached of the Participants linked to your Appointment or Shift. These can help with identification, familiarisation, or simply providing context during your visit.

### Viewing Photos

When you select **Participant Photos**, a photo viewer will open. This works like a carousel — you can swipe left or right to move between the available photos for all Participants that are part of the Appointment or Shift.

If a participant does not have a photo uploaded, the system will still display their name with a default Salesforce placeholder image in place of the photo.

Photos are subject to privacy policies and the participant’s permission. Availability of photos may differ depending on how your organisation manages privacy and data.

### Using the View All Option

In the top right-hand corner, you’ll see a **View All** button. Tapping this will display all available photos in a grid format, making it easier to quickly scan through or select a specific participant photo.
