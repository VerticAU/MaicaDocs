# Cancellation

### What Is the Cancellation Action?

The Cancellation action allows you to record when and why an Appointment or Shift was cancelled. This ensures accurate records for scheduling, compliance, and reporting.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Cancellation option may not be available to all users. Access depends on your organisation’s permissions.
{% endhint %}

### Cancelling an Appointment or Shift

1. Tap the **Cancel** button from the Appointment or Shift actions menu.
2. Complete the required details:
   * **Date and Time** – the point at which the cancellation occurred.
   * **Cancellation Reason** – choose a reason from the dropdown list.
   * **Reason Description** – enter additional notes to provide more context if required.
3. Once all details are entered, tap **Save** to confirm the cancellation.

The Appointment or Shift will then be marked as **Cancelled** in your schedule.

### What Happens After Cancellation?

Cancelled Appointments and Shifts remain visible in your schedule for record-keeping. While you can still view the details, they cannot be actioned or progressed further once marked as cancelled.
