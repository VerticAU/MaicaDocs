# Attach Files

### What Is the Attach Files Action?

The Attach Files action allows you to upload supporting material directly to your Appointment or Shift. This could include photos, videos, or documents that are relevant to the work you’re carrying out.

### How to Upload Files

1. Tap the **Attach Files** button from the Appointment or Shift actions menu.
2. Select **Upload Files** at the bottom of the screen.
3. Choose one of the available options:
   * **Photo Library** – select an image or video already saved on your device.
   * **Take Photo or Video** – use your device’s camera to capture and upload instantly.
   * **Choose Files** – browse your device storage to select an existing file.

File uploads rely on your device’s app permissions.

* If you want to use the **Photo Library**, you’ll need to allow the Salesforce app access to your photos.
* If you want to use **Take Photo or Video**, you’ll need to grant permission for the app to use your camera and microphone.
* If you want to use **Choose Files**, ensure the Salesforce app has permission to access your device storage.
{% endhint %}

Once uploaded, files are attached directly to the Appointment or Shift and can be viewed by you and others with appropriate access.
