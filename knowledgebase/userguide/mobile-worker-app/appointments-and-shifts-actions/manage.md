# Manage

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is an administrative feature. **Manage** is primarily intended for schedulers or administrators responsible for rostering and adjustments. Most care workers will not see this action in their mobile app.
{% endhint %}

#### What does the Manage Action include?

The **Manage** action opens a modal that allows you to update key details of an Appointment or Shift. This is the mobile version of the desktop **Manage Appointment** modal, designed for quick edits when you’re away from the office.

It functions the same way as the desktop version.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

#### When you may use Manage on Mobile

The Manage action is particularly useful if you are away from your desk but need to:

* Reschedule an Appointment or Shift due to a change in availability.
* Reassign a Care Worker at short notice.
* Update location or service details after last-minute changes.
