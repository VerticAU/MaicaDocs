# Check In

#### What does the Check-In Action include?

When you’re ready to begin an appointment or shift, you’ll need to complete the **check-in** process. This records the actual start of your work and makes sure any required checklists are completed.

After tapping **Check-In**, you’ll be asked to confirm a few details before your Appointment or Shift begins. These include your **Appointment Date and Time**, any **Checklist Items** assigned to your Appointmen. Each of these is explained in more detail below.

#### Appointment Date and Time

The first step is confirming the Date and Time of your Appointment. By default, Maica will automatically use the current time. If needed, you can manually edit this field or set it back to the **Scheduled Appointment Time** by selecting the link below the field.

{% hint style="info" %}
This field may or may not be editable. If that’s the case, the Check-In time will always default to the current time when you tap Check-In.
{% endhint %}

#### Appointment Checklist Items

If your Appointment includes a Checklist, you’ll see the list of items here. Each Checklist Item may require you to:

* Change its status (e.g. from “Not Started” to “Completed”).
* Enter notes if extra information is needed.

Checklist Items must be completed before you can finalise your Check-In. As you finish each one, a green tick will appear to show it’s complete. Once all required items are ticked off, the **Check-In** button at the bottom of the screen will activate. As shown below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some Checklist Items are optional, while others are mandatory. **Maica** will automatically prevent Check-In until all mandatory items are complete.
{% endhint %}

#### Check-In Location

Maica will automatically record the location at the time of Check-In to ensure accurate tracking. _Location Services will need to be enabled on your device for this feature to work._
{% endhint %}

#### Completing Your Check-In

When the Date and Time are correct, and all required Checklist Items are completed, tap **Check-In** at the bottom of the screen. Your Appointment or Shift will then begin, and the status will update accordingly.
