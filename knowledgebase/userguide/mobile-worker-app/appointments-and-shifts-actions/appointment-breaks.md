# Appointment Breaks

### What Is the Appointment Breaks Action?

The Appointment Breaks action allows you to record periods of time when you paused work during an Appointment or Shift.&#x20;

### Creating a Break

1. Tap the **Appointment Breaks** button from the Appointment or Shift actions menu.
2. Enter the details of your break, including:
   * **Start Time**
   * **End Time**
   * **Category** (if your organisation requires one)
   * **Notes** (optional, to provide more context)
3. Once the fields are completed, tap **Save**.

In order to maintain the parameters of an Appointment, **Maica** will not allow you to create an Appointment or Shift Break outside the `Date` or `Time` of the Scheduled Appointment.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Managing Breaks

After saving, your break will appear in the **Appointment Breaks list** for that Appointment or Shift. From here, you can:

* Tap a break entry to reopen it.
* **Edit** the details if something needs to be updated.
* **Delete** the break if it was added in error.
