### Creating a New Note

To create a new Participant Note, first select Notes from the Action dropdown, then tap the **New Note** button at the bottom of the Notes screen, as shown below. This will open the note entry form, where you can begin populating the Note.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Creating a Note will likely be available in the Actions dropdown at all stages of an Appointment or Shift, or even directly from the Home Page.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Entering Note Details

Once a new Participant Note has been created, you will be prompted to populate a number of customisable fields.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your organisation has set up note templates, you’ll see a template icon on the left-hand side of the rich text box. Tapping this allows you to insert a pre-configured template, making it quicker and easier to record structured information.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Use the "Create Note for All Participants"checkbox to create the same note for all Participants in the Appointment.

When selected, the Participant field is disabled, and a separate note is automatically created for each Participant.

Each note appears in the modal after saving and can be edited individually.
{% endhint %}

Once you’ve entered all necessary information, tap **Save**. The note will then appear in the Notes list for that Appointment.

### Actions on a Saved Note

After saving, additional actions become available for each note. These include:

* **Attach Files** – Add supporting documents or images to the note.
* **Manage Tasks** – Link tasks to the note for follow-up.
* **Edit** – Update the contents of the note.
* **Delete** – Remove the note if it was created in error.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, you cannot complete actions like attaching files or managing tasks until the note has first been saved. To complete these, re-click the saved note and select the relevant option.\
