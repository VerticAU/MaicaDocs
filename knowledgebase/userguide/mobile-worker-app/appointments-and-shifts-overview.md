# Appointments & Shifts Overview

## Appointments & Shifts Overview

When you tap on an appointment or shift from the **Home screen**, you’ll arrive at the **Appointment/Shift Overview screen**. This is where you’ll see all the important details for the visit, including the location, time, participant, and support team.

## Map & Location

At the top of the screen, you’ll see a **map view** showing where the appointment or shift takes place.

* If there’s a **physical address**, it will be pinned on the map.
* If there is **no physical address**, you’ll instead see a note such as _“No physical address”_.
* If the appointment is **online**, it will be marked clearly as such.

{% hint style="success" %}
Please note, this map is interactive. You can zoom, scroll and navigate it without having to leaving your Appointment or Shift screen.
{% endhint %}

## Appointment or Shift Details

Below the map, you’ll find all the key details for your appointment or shift:

* **Date & Time** – when the Appointment is scheduled.
* **Location** – Address or online status.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Location** field is clickable. Tapping it will open a route directly in Google Maps from the Appointment Overview screen.
{% endhint %}

* **Participant** – who you’ll be supporting.
* **Support Team** – other workers attending the Appointment.
* **Service** (if included) – which service this Appointment relates to.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note, the **Participant** and **Support Team** fields are clickable to open more detailed profiles. If enabled by your organisation, you can tap them to view more information.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* **Appointment Instructions** - any specific requirements for the Appointment or Shift&#x20;
* **Additional Fields** - any additional information configured on the Appointment or Shift

## Actions Menu&#x20;

In the top-right corner, you’ll see an **Actions dropdown**. This menu contains all the additional actions available to you, such as attaching files or taking notes.

All of these actions are explained in detail in the **Appointment & Shift Actions** article, as well as the Check In and Check Out process, including managing travel.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Again, which actions are available **before, during, and after** an Appointment or Shift is determined by your organisation.
