# Planner Overview

## What is the Planner?&#x20;

In **Maica**, the Planner is the primary location for Rostering and Scheduling. It is a versatile tool that is the recommended location to create, manage, edit and view your [`Appointments`](../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) and [`Shifts`](../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/shift.md), as well as manage `Unavailability`. The Planner is at the core of powering the **Maica** lifecycle.&#x20;

## Planner Function Overview

The Planner offers multiple [**Views**](planner-views-and-modes/) and [**Modes**](planner-views-and-modes/), and includes key [**Actions**](planner-actions/) such as Managing Unavailability and Appointment Optimisation. The Planner also offers the ability for you to apply [**Filters**](planner-filter/) to refine and customise your view.&#x20;

For further information on the Planner functions, please click here:&#x20;

* [Planner Filter](planner-filter/)

## Appearance Guide

The `Appearance Guide` button is located at the bottom of the Planner, indicated by an `arrow` button, as shown below.&#x20;

Simply clicking the `arrow` button reveals a legend that outlines the colours and indicators used within the Planner to represent different Appointment statuses and types, as shown below.

This guide will help you quickly determine the type and status of each appointment at a glance, right from the Planner.

To learn how to customise your Planner to your organisations desire, please refer to the [Planner Management](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/planner-management) section in the **Maica** settings.&#x20;

## Timezone Indicator

To help users understand how Appointment times are displayed, the Planner now includes a **Timezone Indicator**, as shown below.

#### How It Works

* The globe icon indicator shows the **current browser timezone** (e.g. _Melbourne_).
* Hovering over the icon reveals a tooltip: **"Your current Time Zone."**
* This helps you know whether the times shown in the Planner are adjusted to your own timezone or reflect a target timezone set on the Appointment.

{% hint style="success" %}
This is especially useful for distributed teams working across multiple time zones, ensuring everyone understands the context of time-based views.
