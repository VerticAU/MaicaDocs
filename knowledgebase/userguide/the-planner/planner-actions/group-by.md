# Group By

## How do Group my information on the Planner?&#x20;

On the Planner, you can group your information in order to make it easier to visualise related items together. For example, in [Shift View](../planner-views-and-modes/shift-view.md), you can order Shifts(s) by Location, which improves organisational clarity and planning.

To begin, simply begin by clicking the `Group By` button, as shown below.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This function is only available in Timeline Mode.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once selected, the custom `Group By Field Selector` module will display, as shown below.&#x20;

It is here you can select which field you wish to organise your information by.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As I have selected the `Group By` action from `Shift View`, the available fields are `Appointment/Shift` fields, as shown above. This is because `Shift View` organises the Planner by `Shift`. If you were to select the `Group By` action from `Accomodation View`, these fields would be catered to `Accomodations`.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

After selecting a field, click `Select` to finalise. Below, I have chosen to Group my Shifts by `Location`.
