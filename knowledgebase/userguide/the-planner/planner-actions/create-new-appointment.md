# Create new Appointment

{% hint style="info" %}
The Create new Appointment Quick Action may be called Create new Shift depending on what View you are in the Maica Planner. It is the same tool, but can be used for both Appointments or Shifts.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## How do I create a new Appointment or Shift from the Planner?&#x20;

There are multiple ways to create a new Appointment or Shift from the Planner, this article will show you how to use the Quick Action.

Simply begin by clicking the `+` button, as shown below.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also create an Appointment or Shift by dragging and releasing your mouse directly onto the Planner. To learn more, click [here](../../appointments/create-an-appointment/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once done, either the `New Appointment` or `New Shift` module will display. Maica determines which module to display based on what [View](../planner-views-and-modes/) you are in. Please refer to the table below to see which [View](../planner-views-and-modes/) opens which module:&#x20;

| View                                                                  | Module            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| [Schedule](../planner-views-and-modes/schedule.md)                    | `New Appointment` |
| [Participant View](../planner-views-and-modes/participant-view.md)    | `New Appointment` |
| [Asset View ](../planner-views-and-modes/asset-view.md)               | `New Appointment` |
| [Accomodation View ](../planner-views-and-modes/accomodation-view.md) | `New Appointment` |
| [Roster View ](../planner-views-and-modes/roster-view.md)             | `New Shift`       |
| [Shift View ](../planner-views-and-modes/shift-view.md)               | `New Shift`       |

Once the applicable module has been shown, create your `Appointment` or `Shift` by following the same steps detailed [here](../../appointments/create-an-appointment/).

{% hint style="info" %}
There will be no pre-populated fields if you create an `Appointment` or `Shift` through the Quick Action.&#x20;
