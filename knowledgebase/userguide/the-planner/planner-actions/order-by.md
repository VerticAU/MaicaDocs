# Order By

## How do Order my information on the Planner?&#x20;

On the Planner, you can order your information in order to make it easier to locate or prioritise data. For example, in [Schedule View](../planner-views-and-modes/schedule.md), you can order Resource(s) by Age Group, which improves visibility and planning efficiency.

To begin, simply begin by clicking the `Order By` button, as shown below.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This function is only available in Timeline Mode.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once selected, the custom `Filter By Field Selector` module will display, as shown below.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note, all fields with an `>` have additional fields available within them, however you can also `Order By` the parent field.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

It is here you can select which field you wish to organise your information by.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As I have selected the `Order By` action from `Schedule View`, the available fields are `Resource` fields, as shown above. This is because `Schedule View` organises the Planner by `Resource`. If you were to select the `Order By` action from `Accomodation View`, these fields would be catered to `Accomodations`.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

After selecting a field, click `Select` to finalise. Below, I have chosen to Order my Resources by `Age Group`.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you have selected a field in which to order your information, you can change the order from ascending to descending by simply clicking the `Arrow` button to the left of the `Order By` button. &#x20;
{% endhint %}
