You have three options on the Planner to choose the date you want to view:

<table><thead><tr><th width="108">Number</th><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td><code>Next/Previous</code></td><td>The next and previous arrows allow you to navigate to the previous or next date range based on the selected period. Eg, if your period is selected to month, the next button will take you to the next month. </td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><code>Select Date</code> </td><td>Clicking on the calendar icon opens a date picker, allowing you to manually select a specific date or date range (depending on the selected period) to display in the planner.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><code>Today</code> </td><td>The <code>Today</code> button quickly returns your view to the current date, no matter where you are in the planner.</td></tr></tbody></table>
