# Roster View

## What information does the Roster View display?

The Roster View is an overview of all `Shift` and `Unavailability` information.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You have the option to display both unfilled `Shifts` and `Shifts` with allocated `Resource(s)`, as well as showing only `Resource(s)` with `Shifts` in Timeline Mode. To learn more, click [here](../planner-filter/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Calendar Mode

On Calendar Mode, Roster View will display your Planner with the above information within a grid based on the days and hours of the [selected period](./#how-do-i-select-my-display-options-in-the-planner).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that both the colour theming of the cells and the information presented within the cells are configurable. To learn more, click [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/planner-management).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Timeline Mode

On Timeline Mode, Roster View will organise your Planner by `Resource(s)`. This will display all of the `Resource(s)` that have `Shifts` populated on the left , and all of their associated `Shifts` and `Unavailability` on the right.

When you make a Shift from Timeline Mode in Roster View, the Appointment will be pre-populated with the Resource of the row on which you created it.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also display all Resource(s), not just those with allocated Shifts. To learn more, click [here](../planner-filter/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you use the [`Group By`](../planner-actions/group-by.md) Planner Action, **Maica** will show helpful indicators on your Planner to inform you of how many unique `Shifts(s)` you have at any given time, as shown below.&#x20;

Here, we have have grouped by `Location`, and **Maica** is showing us that during the three time slots we have 1 unique `Shift`.&#x20;

The colours of the numbers indicate the filled status of the Shift(s), as per below:&#x20;

* **Green**: Shifts filled with the required number of Resource(s).&#x20;
* **Yellow**: Shifts partially filled with the required number of Resource(s).&#x20;
* **Red**: Shifts not filled with the any Resource(s).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
An unfilled Shift is any Shift that does not have the required number of Resources allocated.
