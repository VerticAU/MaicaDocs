# Shift View

## What information does the Shift View display?

The Shift View is an overview of all `Shift` information.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You have the option to display both unfilled `Shifts` and `Shifts` with allocated `Resource(s)`. To learn more, click [here](../planner-filter/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Calendar Mode

On Calendar Mode, Shift View will display your Planner with the above information within a grid based on the days and hours of the [selected period](./#how-do-i-select-my-display-options-in-the-planner).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In the above image you can see the Shift on Thursday 5th September has a red outline, this is an unfilled Shift. \
\
An unfilled Shift is any Shift that does not have the required number of Resources allocated.
{% endhint %}

### Timeline Mode

On Timeline Mode, Roster View will organise your Planner by `Shift(s)`. This will display all of the `Shifts(s)` in chronological order.

{% hint style="info" %}
The details displayed on each Shift cell are configurable. To learn more, click [here](../planner-filter/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Similar to [Roster View](roster-view.md), If you use the `Group By` Planner Action, **Maica** will show helpful indicators on your Planner to inform you of how many unique `Shifts(s)` you have at any given time, as shown above.

{% hint style="info" %}
For further information on these indicators, please click [here](roster-view.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In addition, a few useful interaction features are available on the Shift cell in Timeline Mode on Shift View. These are:

<table><thead><tr><th width="298">Element </th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>Shift</code> Fill </td><td>This Tooltip shows how many <code>Resource(s)</code> are assigned to each <code>Shift</code> based on the required number of <code>Resource(s)</code> to fill the <code>Shift</code>.</td></tr><tr><td>Unfilled Row </td><td>This row shows all unfilled <code>Shift(s)</code> in one location for ease of access to populate any unfilled <code>Shift(s)</code>. </td></tr></tbody></table>
