# Agenda View

## What information does the Agenda View display?

The Agenda View displays your Planner information in a list format, grouped by day. Instead of showing events on a grid, it provides a sequential agenda of **Appointments**, making it easy to quickly review what is scheduled for each day.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Agenda Mode only displays Appointments, in order to see Shifts, please use [Schedule](schedule.md), [Roster](roster-view.md) or [Shift](shift-view.md) Views.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Agenda Mode

{% hint style="success" %}
Please note, in Agenda View there is no toggle between Calendar or Timeline Mode, it is simply Agenda Mode.
{% endhint %}

In Agenda Mode, your Planner information will be displayed within a scrolling list organised by date. Each day expands to show all of its associated **Appointments** and **Shifts**, with details such as:

* **Time** of the Appointment or Shift
* **Participant(s)** allocated (if applicable)
* **Location** recorded on the Appointment

{% hint style="info" %}
Inline with the rest of the Planner, the information on these cells in Agenda View are configurable in the Planner Management Settings. To learn more, [click here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/planner-management).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note, drag & drop functionality will be locked when the Planner is in Agenda View.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

When you create or edit an Appointment in Agenda Mode, it will automatically appear in the correct chronological order for the day.&#x20;
