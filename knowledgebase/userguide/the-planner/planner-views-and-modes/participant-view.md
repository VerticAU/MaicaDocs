# Participant View

## What information does the Participant View display?

The Participant View is organised by `Participants`.  In Calendar Mode, it shows all Appointment and Shift related Planner information, and in Timeline Mode it organises all `Appointments` and `Shifts` by associated `Participants`. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You have the option to display both unfilled `Appointments` and `Appointments` with allocated `Participant(s)`. To learn more, click [here](../planner-filter/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Calendar Mode

On Calendar Mode, Participant View will display your Planner with the above information within a grid based on the days and hours of the [selected period](./#how-do-i-select-my-display-options-in-the-planner).&#x20;

Please note that both the cascade effect shown above and the information presented within the cells are configurable. To learn more, click [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/planner-management).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Timeline Mode

On Timeline Mode, Participant View will organise your Planner by `Participant(s)`. This will display all of the `Participant(s)` that have `Appointments` populated on the left , and all of their associated `Appointments` on the right.

When you make an Appointment from Timeline Mode in Participant View, the Appointment will be pre-populated with the Participant of the row on which you created it.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also display all Participant(s), not just those with allocated Appointments. To learn more, click [here](../planner-filter/). \

Please note, **Maica** defines a Participant as a Contact with an active Service Agreement. Contacts without an active Service Agreement will not be displayed.&#x20;
