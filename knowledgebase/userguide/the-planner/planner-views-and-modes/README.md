# Planner Views & Modes

## What is a Planner View?&#x20;

A Planner `View` in **Maica** is defines what type of data is displayed in the Planner. It allows users to switch between different categories to focus on specific scheduling information. Each view determines which `Shifts` and `Appointments` are shown based on the selected focus and each view is tailored to a particular need within an organisation.

**Maica** provides various Planner views.&#x20;

The below list outlines the available views on the **Maica** Planner:&#x20;

* [Schedule](schedule.md)&#x20;
* [Agenda View](agenda-view.md)
* [Participant View](participant-view.md)&#x20;
* [Asset View](asset-view.md)&#x20;
* [Accomodation View](accomodation-view.md)&#x20;
* [Roster View](roster-view.md)&#x20;
* [Shift View](shift-view.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Planner Views have a direct relationship with the [Planner Modes](./#id-2.-planner-mode-overview). Each `View` will display slightly different information depending on what `Mode` is selected. As a result, please refer to the information below outlining the [Planner Modes](./#id-2.-planner-mode-overview) before continuing learning about the Planner Views.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To dive deeper into each view, please visit the specific pages for detailed information on every view.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, the following descriptions of each View are explained per **Maica's** default settings. To learn how to customise your displays further, please refer to the [Planner Filter](../planner-filter/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## What is a Planner Mode?&#x20;

A Planner `Mode` in **Maica** refers to the layout or format used to display the schedule. The two `Modes` in **Maica's** planner are `Timeline Mode` and `Calendar Mode`.

* `Timeline Mode`: This mode presents `Appointments` and `Shifts` in a horizontal timeline, displaying the schedule across a selected time period while aligning the selected view category along the side.&#x20;
* `Calendar Mode`: This mode offers a more traditional calendar view, where `Appointments` and `Shifts` are displayed within a grid based on the days and hours of the [selected period](./#how-do-i-select-my-display-options-in-the-planner).&#x20;

You can toggle between these `Modes` to choose how the schedule is visually represented within each `View`.

## How do I select my display options in the Planner?&#x20;

When in the Planner, you can adjust your display options by simply using the following buttons:&#x20;

To change the day in which your Planner starts with, head to the [Planner Management](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/planner-management) settings. Maica will default this to Monday, however, you can select any day of the week to suit your needs.&#x20;
