# Asset View

## What information does the Asset View display?

The Asset View is organised by `Assets`.  In Calendar Mode, it shows all Appointment and Shift related Planner information, and in Timeline Mode it organises all `Appointments` and `Shifts` by associated `Assets`. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can display all Assets(s), not just those with allocated Appointments or Shifts if desired. To learn more, click [here](../planner-filter/).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Calendar Mode

On Calendar Mode, Asset View will display your Planner with the above information within a grid based on the days and hours of the [selected period](./#how-do-i-select-my-display-options-in-the-planner), as shown below.&#x20;

Please note that both the cascade effect shown above and the information presented within the cells are configurable. To learn more, click [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/planner-management).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Timeline Mode

On Timeline Mode, Asset View will organise your Planner by `Asset(s)`. This will display all of the `Asset(s)` that are assigned to `Appointments` and `Shifts` populated on the left , and all of their associated `Appointments` and `Shifts` on the right.

When you make an Appointment from Timeline Mode in Asset View, the Appointment will be pre-populated with the Asset of the row on which you created it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that both the Asset Name and Type presented beneath their name within the Asset cells are configurable. To learn more, click [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/planner-management).&#x20;
