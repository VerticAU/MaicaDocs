# Accomodation View

## What information does the Accomodation View display?

The Accomodation View is organised by `Accomodations`. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
An `Accomodation` is a specific area within a `Location` record. The `Accomodation` view will be grouped by `Location` by default on Timeline Mode.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In Calendar Mode, Accomodation View shows all Appointment related Planner information, and in Timeline Mode it organises all `Appointments` by associated `Accomodations`. &#x20;

### Calendar Mode

On Calendar Mode, Asset View will display your Planner with the above information within a grid based on the days and hours of the [selected period](./#how-do-i-select-my-display-options-in-the-planner).&#x20;

Please note that both the cascade effect shown above and the information presented within the cells are configurable. To learn more, click [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/planner-management).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Timeline Mode

On Timeline Mode, Accomodation View will organise your Planner by `Accomodation(s)`. This will display all of the `Accomodation(s)` that are assigned to `Appointments` on the left , and all of their associated `Appointments` on the right.

When you make an Appointment from Timeline Mode in Accomodation View, the Appointment will be pre-populated with the Accomodation of the row on which you created it.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Timeline Mode, Accomodation View will be [Grouped By](../planner-actions/group-by.md) Location by default.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If the `Group By` Planner Action is in use, **Maica** will show helpful indicators on your Planner to inform you of how many unique `Appointment(s)` you have at any given time, as shown above by the `Green 1`. To learn more about these indicators, click [here](roster-view.md).&#x20;
