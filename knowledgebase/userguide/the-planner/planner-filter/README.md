# Planner Filter

## What is the Planner Filter?&#x20;

The Planner Filter in **Maica** is a tool that allows users to refine and customise the information displayed on the Planner. By selecting specific criteria, you can narrow down the view to focus on relevant information and data. The Planner Filter ensures that users can efficiently manage and organise Appointments, Shifts, Resources, and Participants based on the selected filters.

## Where do I find the Planner Filter?&#x20;

The Planner Filter is located on the far left hand side of the Planner menu, as shown below:&#x20;

Once you have selected the Filter, **Maica** offers two filtering options. These are:&#x20;

1. [Basic Filters](basic-filters.md)&#x20;
2. [Advanced Filters](advanced-filters.md)

For further in-depth information on each filtering option, please refer to the associated page.

## Planner Filter Applied Notification

When a Filter of any type is applied in the **Planner**, whether it's a **Basic** or **Advanced** filter, the **filter icon** circled above will turn **Yellow**.&#x20;

This provides a visual cue that a filter is currently active. To reset the view, simply click the filter icon and clear the selected filters.
