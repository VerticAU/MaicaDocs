# Cancel an Invoice

## How do I Cancel an Invoice?&#x20;

In **Maica**, you can `Cancel` an Invoice through the Cancel Quick Action found in the dropdown menu located in the top right corner of your interface. Firstly, click the dropdown icon to display the extended Menu options, as shown below.&#x20;

Then, simply click `Cancel`.

After doing so, **Maica** will display a pop-up confirming you wish to Cancel your Invoice. Simply click `Confirm` to complete the cancellation process. Once done, **Maica** will replace the Status bar with a cancellation alert, as shown below.&#x20;

You cannot `Cancel` an Invoice with a `Fully Paid` status.&#x20;

## What happens after my Invoice has been cancelled?&#x20;

Once you have successfully cancelled your Invoice, three things will automatically occur in Maica, these are:&#x20;

1. **Maica** will set the [`Status`](../invoice-overview/#invoice-statuses) of your Invoice to `Cancelled`.&#x20;
2. The related Field will show `Cancelled` = `TRUE`. This is referenced in the [Invoice Status Flow](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/data/data-objects/invoice#invoice-status-management).&#x20;
3. Invoice History records will be generated reflecting the Date & Time in which the cancellation occurred. These are records accessible directly from the Invoice, as shown below.&#x20;
