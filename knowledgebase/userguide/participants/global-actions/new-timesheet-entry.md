# New Timesheet Entry

## How do I create a new Timesheet Entry from the Maica Actions Menu?

To begin creating a new [Timesheet Entry](new-timesheet-entry.md) from the **Maica Actions** menu, simply click the `New Timesheet Entry` option and you will be presented with the pop-up to begin populating your [Entry](new-timesheet-entry.md).&#x20;

Similar to creating a new [Billable Participant Note](../billable-participant-notes/) from the [Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md), after the pop-up is presented, a few stages must be completed before the [Note](../billable-participant-notes/) can be confirmed.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

## Pre-populated Fields

When creating a Timesheet Entry from the **Maica Actions** menu, the Date & Time will be pre-populated. **Maica** will pre-populate this field to the `current` Date & Time of the action selected, and will automatically set the Entry duration to `60 minutes`.  This can be changed manually during the [Timesheet Entry](new-timesheet-entry.md) creation.&#x20;
