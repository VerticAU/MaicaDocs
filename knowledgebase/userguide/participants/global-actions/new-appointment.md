# New Appointment

## How do I create an Appointment from the Maica Actions Menu?

To begin creating a new [Appointments](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) from the **Maica Actions** menu, simply click the `New Appointment` option and you will be presented with the `New Appointment` pop-up.&#x20;

Similar to creating a new [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) from the [Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md), after the pop-up is presented, a few stages must be completed before the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) can be confirmed.&#x20;

To learn more about the details and stages of creating a New Appointment, click [here](../../appointments/create-an-appointment/#appointment-stages).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Pre-populated Fields

When creating an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) from the **Maica Actions** menu, the Date & Time will be pre-populated. **Maica** will pre-populate this field to the `current` Date & Time of the action selected, and will automatically set the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) duration to `60 minutes`.  This can be changed manually in the [Basic Details](../../appointments/create-an-appointment/basic-details.md) stage of the [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) creation.&#x20;

You can also change your default duration in Maica Settings; click here to learn more.&#x20;
