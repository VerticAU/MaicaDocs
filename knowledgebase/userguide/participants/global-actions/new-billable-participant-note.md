# New Billable Participant Note

## How do I create a new Billable Participant Note from the Maica Actions Menu?

To begin creating a new [Note](../billable-participant-notes/) from the **Maica Actions** menu, simply click the `New Billable Participant Note` option and you will be presented with the pop-up to begin populating your [Note](../billable-participant-notes/).&#x20;

Similar to creating a new [Billable Participant Note](../billable-participant-notes/) from the [Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md), after the pop-up is presented, a few stages must be completed before the [Note](../billable-participant-notes/) can be confirmed.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

## Pre-populated Fields

When creating a Billable Participant Note from the **Maica Actions** menu, the Date & Time will be pre-populated. **Maica** will pre-populate this field to the `current` Date & Time of the action selected, and will automatically set the [Note](../billable-participant-notes/) duration to `15 minutes`.  This can be changed manually in the [Take a Note](../billable-participant-notes/take-a-note.md) stage of the [Note](../billable-participant-notes/) creation.&#x20;

You can also change your default duration in Maica Settings; click here to learn more.&#x20;
