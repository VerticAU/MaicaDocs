# New Shift

## How do I create an Shift from the Maica Actions Menu?

To begin creating a new [Shifts](/broken/pages/zNYLCCfkOlI0IqQ3sOvl) from the **Maica Actions** menu, simply click the `New Shift` option and you will be presented with the `New Shift` pop-up.&#x20;

Similar to creating a new [Shifts](/broken/pages/zNYLCCfkOlI0IqQ3sOvl) from the [Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md), after the pop-up is presented, a few stages must be completed before the [Shifts](/broken/pages/zNYLCCfkOlI0IqQ3sOvl) can be confirmed.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

## Pre-populated Fields

When creating an [Shifts](/broken/pages/zNYLCCfkOlI0IqQ3sOvl) from the **Maica Actions** menu, the Date & Time will be pre-populated. **Maica** will pre-populate this field to the `current` Date & Time of the action selected, and will automatically set the [Shifts](/broken/pages/zNYLCCfkOlI0IqQ3sOvl) duration to `60 minutes`.  This can be changed manually in the [Basic Details](../../appointments/create-an-appointment/basic-details.md) stage of the [Shifts](/broken/pages/zNYLCCfkOlI0IqQ3sOvl) creation.&#x20;

You can also change your default duration in Maica Settings; click here to learn more.&#x20;
