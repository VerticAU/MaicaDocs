# Global Actions

## What are Global Actions?

Global actions are a versatile feature that allow you to do a variety of tasks easily from anywhere in `Salesforce`, including the Home Page and Mobile App. The **Maica Actions** offer easy and instant access to important **Maica** functions, including:

* [New Appointment ](new-appointment.md)
* [New Billable Participant Note ](new-billable-participant-note.md)
* [New Timesheet Entry ](new-timesheet-entry.md)

## How do I access Global Actions?&#x20;

To get started, you can find the Global Actions menu, which is represented by a `+` icon, in the top right corner of your interface. As shown below.&#x20;

The **Maica Actions** are custom actions specifically designed for **Maica**, whilst the other actions available in the Global Actions dropdown are standard `Salesforce` actions available by default in any `Salesforce` organisation. &#x20;
