# NDIS Funding

## How is NDIS Funding Managed in Maica?&#x20;

In **Maica**, `Funding` for NDIS `Participants` is managed through Quick Actions located on the Contact Record. These are further explained in more detail [below](./#participant-record-actions).&#x20;

However, before diving into the Quick Actions, please review the Key Terms that should be noted when using **Maica's** `Funding` operations.

## Key Terms&#x20;

Maica uses a number of key terms which are important in helping you understand how the solution manages NDIS Participant Funding. In **Maica**, the term Funding is used to represent the term `Plan` used by the NDIS. These terms are explained in the table below:&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="230">Maica Key Term</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>Funding Record</code> </td><td>Represents the specific details of a Participants Plan from their associated <code>Funding</code> body.

## Participant Record Actions

Now, to begin managing your NDIS Participants Funding, you should use the Quick Actions on the Contact Record. **Maica's** `Contact` Records have unique actions to help you manage crucial pieces of information for your NDIS `Participants`. To learn more about the these actions, see below.&#x20;

### [Synchronise Participant Information](synchronise-participant-information.md)

The `Synchronise Participant Information` Quick Action in **Maica** allows you to connect with the PRODA/NDIS systems to retrieve key `Participant` data such as Plan Records, Plan Budgets, Plan Goals, and Service Bookings from the NDIS which will be used to populate your Participants `Funding Record` in **Maica**.&#x20;

### Create Service Booking

The `Create Service Booking` Quick Action in Maica allows you to create Service Bookings for your `Participants` that will Sync directly with the NDIS. This Action sits within the [Funding Record](funding-record-overview.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If your `Participants` are **PACE** `Participants` `Service Bookings` will not be required and hence this Action will not be visible.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The `Create Service Booking` Quick Action helps ensure that the allocated funds and service details are accurately reflected in both **Maica** and the NDIS system.
