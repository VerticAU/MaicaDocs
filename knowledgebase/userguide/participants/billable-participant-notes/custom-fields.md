# Custom Fields

## What does the Custom Fields stage include?

The Custom Fields tab captures any information from Custom Fields that have been added to your Organisations profile beyond what **Maica** offers. This stage functions the same way it does within an [Appointment](../../appointments/create-an-appointment/custom-fields.md).&#x20;

Where this is the case, and the custom fields have been configured, this stage will present **all** configured custom fields using the input relevant to their data type. This includes the ability to select pick lists, dates, lookups, and other options based on the configuration of your own Custom Fields.

If no Custom Fields have been configured, this stage of the process will not show and you will be directed straight to the `Add Tasks` stage.  &#x20;
