# Files

## How do I attach Files to my Billable Participant Note?

To begin attaching a file, simply click the `Upload Files` button at the bottom of the screen to bring up the dialogue box. Once selected, you can attach files to your Participant Note. This includes the ability to take a photo, attach a PDF file, or upload any other allowed file type.&#x20;

On a mobile device, this will also feature the option to take a photo while uploading the file.&#x20;

## What happens after I create a Billable Participant Note?

As this is the last stage, once you have attached all your required Files simply click the `Save & Close` button to complete your Billable Participant Note.&#x20;

After you create a Billable Participant Note, **Maica** will have created both an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) and a Participant Note. The Note will be stored against the Participant and can be viewed in the [Participants Profile](../../appointments/appointment-actions/open-appointment-profile.md), whilst the Appointment will be automatically assigned a `Complete` status and used within Maica for Billing.&#x20;

The same logic applies if your Participant Note is not Billable, however, there will be no Invoice Line Item.&#x20;
