# Tasks

## What does the Tasks stage include?&#x20;

The `Tasks` tab offers the ability to add any `Tasks` to your Billable Participant Note. This is a record of an action or activity that needs to be completed or has already been completed.

## How do I add a Tasks to my Billable Participant Note?

To begin adding tasks for your Participant Note(s), simply click the the `+` button in the top right corner of the screen.

Once a new Participant Note Task has been created, you will be prompted to populate a number of customisable fields, including assigning your task to the required personnel.

You can assign a task to any other **Maica** user within your organisation.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can open the text input box by clicking the arrow on the far right hand side of the screen, as shown below.&#x20;

### 1. Unsaved Changes

If you are presented with the below error when clicking the `Save & Next` button and hence trying to proceed to the next stage of creating your Billable Participant Note, it means you have not properly saved a created Task.&#x20;

In order to resolve this, simply ensure the `Blue Tick` in the top right hand corner of your interface (as shown above) has been clicked on all Tasks. This makes sure they are properly saved and allows you to proceed to the [Files](files.md) stage.&#x20;
