# Billable Participant Notes

## What is a Billable Note?&#x20;

A `Billable Participant Note` is a documented interaction provided to a participant that is eligible for billing. For example, a [Resource](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/resource.md) of yours may deliver a [Service](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment-service.md) over the phone and record and document the call as a Note. As a [Service](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment-service.md) was delivered, this may be considered billable under the [Service Agreement](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/service-agreement.md).&#x20;

After you create a Billable Participant Note, **Maica** will have created both an [Appointment](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/appointment.md) and a Participant Note. The Note will be stored against the Participant and can be viewed in the [Participants Profile](../../appointments/appointment-actions/open-appointment-profile.md), whilst the Appointment will be automatically assigned a `Complete` status and used within Maica for Billing.&#x20;

The same logic applies if your Participant Note is not Billable, however, there will be no Invoice Line Item.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
