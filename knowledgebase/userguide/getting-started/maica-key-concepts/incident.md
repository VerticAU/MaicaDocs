# Incident

### **Definition**

An Incident in Maica is a record used to capture and manage events that impact the safety, wellbeing, or service delivery of a [Participant](participant.md) or [Resource](resource.md).

It includes important details such as the **type of incident**, **severity level**, **reporter**, **linked participant**, and **date of occurrence**, helping you maintain clear and consistent reporting across all areas of care.

Typical examples of incidents include medication errors, behavioural events, injuries, property damage, or other occurrences that require documentation and review.
{% endhint %}

### **Purpose**

The purpose of the Incident object is to provide a centralised, transparent way to record and manage critical events.

By logging incidents within Maica, you can ensure that events are tracked from the first report to final resolution with full visibility, accountability, and compliance in mind.

Incidents are linked to related records such as **Participants**, **Appointments**, and **Reporters**, allowing staff to easily trace context and outcomes.

### **Usage**

Incidents are used widely across Maica to support compliance, reporting, and internal reviews.\
Staff can create new incident records directly from the **Participant Profile** or [**Mobile App**](../../mobile-worker-app/appointments-and-shifts-actions/incidents.md), allowing quick and accurate data capture in real time.

Each incident record can include:

* **Type** – classifies the nature of the event (e.g., injury, behavioural, medication).
* **Severity Level** – determines the seriousness or potential impact of the incident.
* **Reporter and Owner** – identifies who logged the incident and who is responsible for follow-up.
* **Status** – tracks the incident’s progress from open to resolved.
* **Description and Outcome** – summarises key details and final actions taken.

### **Final Thoughts**

Incident records play a vital role in ensuring safety, compliance, and service quality within Maica.\
By capturing detailed information and linking incidents to relevant Participants or Appointments, your team can maintain transparency, reduce risks, and continuously improve care standards.

Over time, the insights gathered from Incident data help strengthen organisational practices — turning every recorded event into an opportunity for learning and improvement.
