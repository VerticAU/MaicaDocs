# Service Agreement

### Definition

A Service Agreement is the financial construct under which a [Participant](participant.md) receives services. This includes the ability to set up funding structures compliant with the NDIS, Aged Care and other funding arrangements. Service Agreement capture information such as [Support Items](support-item.md), [Price Lists](price-list.md) as well as key dates during which the Service Agreement is valid.

### Purpose

The purpose of Service Agreements is to ensure that services are not delivered without verified funding. Maica considers the entire Participant Lifecycle as one connected process and therefore, it is critical that a [Participant](participant.md) has the appropriate Service Agreement funding in place prior to receiving services.&#x20;

### Usage

Service Agreements are a fundamental concept in Maica and these records are essential to being able to deliver services to your [Participants](participant.md). Maica validates that the relevant funding, via a Service Agreement, is in place throughout the Maica lifecycle, including whilst managing:

* [Appointments](appointment.md)
* [Shifts](shift.md)
* [Billable Participant Notes](../../participants/billable-participant-notes/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Maica considers a Salesforce Contact to be a [Participant](participant.md) (or Client) only when an active Service Agreement is captured. It is important to note that the Service Agreement does not need to be fully funded but it does need to exist.
{% endhint %}

### Final Thoughts

Service Agreements provide you with assurance that a particular service to your [Participants](participant.md) is financially covered. Maica will inform the end user, pending their permissions, that any available funding may be exceeded without actually stopping the service from proceeding.
