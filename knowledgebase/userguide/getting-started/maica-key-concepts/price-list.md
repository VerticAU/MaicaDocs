# Price List

### Definition

A Maica Price List is a collection of [Support Items](support-item.md) and their associated unit prices within the Price List. This allows you to configure multiple Price Lists and charge varying amount for your services, via [Support Items](support-item.md), without having to replicate [Support Items](support-item.md).

### Purpose

The purpose of Price Lists is to control a consistent pricing strategy across an organisation, where services, given the same circumstances, are charged at the same unit prices. This primarily prevents pricing errors as well as manual administration of individual [Support Items](support-item.md).

### Usage

The main use case for Price Lists is to associate them with [Service Agreements](service-agreement.md) to control pricing for the duration of the [Service Agreement](service-agreement.md), although this can be changed throughout of course.

### Final Thoughts

Price Lists are a fairly straight forward concept but offer a significant advantage in managing service pricing throughout the journey. Whilst multiple Price Lists are not required (only one is mandated to manage [Service Agreements](service-agreement.md)), we encourage you to arrange your pricing structures across multiple Price Lists to ease the administration burden as well as prevent billing errors.
