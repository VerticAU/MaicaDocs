# Timesheet

### Definition

A Timesheet is a record to capture time spent delivering services for a given [Resource](resource.md). This includes information about the [Appointment](appointment.md) or [Shift](shift.md) related to the service, any breaks taken as well as travel times where applicable.

### Purpose

Timesheet records are not technically critical to the lifecycle within the Maica solution although the typical purpose is to provide an award interpretation and payroll system with the relevant data to process payments for your [Resources](resource.md).

### Usage

Timesheets are generated following the successful completion of either [Appointments](appointment.md) or [Shifts](shift.md), via checking out or quick completing these.&#x20;

### Final Thoughts

Timesheets can be enabled or actually fully disabled in Maica. If enabled, each Resource can then be set up for Timesheets generation individually.&#x20;
