# Appointment

### Definition

An Appointment is the principal way of organising services to your [Participants](participant.md) into timeslots across your care team, including capturing the following key information:

* [Participant](participant.md)[s](participant.md) who are being serviced as part of the Appointment
* [Resource](resource.md)[s](resource.md) who are delivering the service as part of the Appointment
* [Appointment Services](appointment-service.md) which are being delivered as part of the Appointment
* [Location](../../appointments/create-an-appointment/location.md) at which the Appointment is being held
* Recurrance if the Appointment is a repeating service being delivered

You can learn how to create Appointments [here](../../the-planner/planner-actions/create-new-appointment.md).
{% endhint %}

### Purpose

An Appointment sets out the structure under which services are delivered to [Participants](participant.md). They are visually represented in the [Maica Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md) and can be accessed using either the web browser or mobile device (using the Salesforce mobile application).

### Usage

In Maica, Appointments form the central mechanism by which information about delivered services is captured and managed. Appointments are primarily managed through the [Maica Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md) and can be created or managed by any authorised end user, whether this be a dedicated scheduling team member or the [Resource](resource.md) themselves.

### Final Thoughts

The majority of service delivery and billing is managed via Appointments, with the exception of [Shifts](shift.md), and therefore these records form a fundamental part of Maica. With the use of various available sections and custom fields, you can really make the Appointment management experience your own.
