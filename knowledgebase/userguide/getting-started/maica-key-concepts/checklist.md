# Checklist

### Definition

A Checklist is essentially a list of applicable tasks (Checklist Items) that a [Resource](resource.md) will perform and acknowledge either before/during/after an [Appointment](appointment.md) or [Shift](shift.md). A typical example of this might be to do a COVID test, complete an assessment, or greet the [Participant](participant.md). An example of a Checklist might be:

| Checklist Name           | Checklist Item      | Sequence |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- | -------- |
| Pre-Appointment Check In | Greet Participant   | Before   |
|                          | COVID Test          | Before   |
|                          | Complete Assessment | After    |

### Purpose

The purpose is to control tasks that need to be completed as part of an [Appointment](appointment.md) or [Shift](shift.md) that are not billable to a Participant's [Service Agreement](service-agreement.md) but are required for compliance, security, or client care.

### Usage

Checklists are used within [Appointments](appointment.md) and [Shifts](shift.md) to show at various points throughout the journey, including:

* Check In
* Check Out
* Appointment Management
* Shift Management

### Final Thoughts

Checklists are a really good way to get your Resources to perform tasks that are either common to your process, address compliance issues or simply record that the right tasks are done at the appropriate time.&#x20;

You can then easily report on progress whether this be the completion or not of certain tasks (Checklist Items).
