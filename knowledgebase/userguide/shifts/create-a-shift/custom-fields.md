# Custom Fields

## What does the Custom Fields stage include?

The Custom Fields tab captures any information from Custom Fields that have been added to your Organisations Shift profile beyond what **Maica** offers.&#x20;

Where this is the case, and the custom fields have been configured, this stage will present **all** configured custom fields using the input relevant to their data type. This includes the ability to select picklists, dates, lookups, and other options based on the configuration of your own Custom Fields.

Here, both `City` and `Service Region` have been added to the Custom Fields stage, as shown below.&#x20;

Custom Fields can be added via the Maica Settings. To learn more, click [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/service-management).&#x20;

If no Custom Fields have been configured, this stage of the Shift creation process will not show and you will be directed straight to the [Summary](../../appointments/create-an-appointment/summary.md) stage.  &#x20;
