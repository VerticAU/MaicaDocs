# Summary

## What does the Summary stage include?

The Summary provides an overview of the Shift, including the selected `Start Date`, `Start Time`, `End Date` and `End Time`. It also summarises each selected Shift Service, as shown in the below image and by the below table:

<table><thead><tr><th width="178">Reference </th><th>Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>This is the Shift Service selected at the <a href="basic-details.md">Basic Details</a> stage</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>This is the Claim Type selected at the <a href="../../appointments/create-an-appointment/basic-details.md">Basic Details</a> stage</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>This is the quantity of the created Shift based on the <code>Start Time</code> and <code>End Time</code>. For example, the shown Appointment time is from 8:00am - 11:00am, this is a quantity of 3 which represents 3 hours. This field is adjustable for each Shift Service, please refer to the <a href="summary.md#id-1.-adjusted-quantity">Adjusted Quantity</a> section below for further information. </td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>This is the Number of Shifts based on the Recurring Schedule calculated at the <a href="schedule.md">Schedule</a> stage.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Things to look out for: Summary

### 1. Adjusted Quantity

Adjusting the quantity offers you flexibility within an Shift to control how long each Service may be delivered within a Shift. For example, if `Supported Independent Living` was delivered for the full 3 hours, but `Occupational Therapy Services` was only delivered for 1 hour, you could adjust the quantity.&#x20;

When adjusting the quantity for a Service, **Maica** will alert you with a symbol indicating that you have individual Shift Service that does not correspond with the details of your Shift. This is not an error, but rather an alert to identify the adjusted quantity. Please refer to the image below for an example with an updated quantity and the changes **Maica** will display:
