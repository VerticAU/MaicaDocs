# Attach Files

## How do I attach a file to a Shift?&#x20;

To begin attaching a file, simply open a Shift and then click the `Files` button at the bottom of the screen to bring up the dialogue box. Once selected, you can attach files to the Shift. This includes the ability to take a photo, attach a PDF file, or upload any other allowed file type.

On a mobile device, this will also feature the option to take a photo while uploading the file, as illustrated below.
