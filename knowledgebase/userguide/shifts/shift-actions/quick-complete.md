# Quick Complete

## What is Quick Completing a Shift?&#x20;

Quick Completing a [Shift](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/shift.md) essentially bypasses the checking in/out processes and sets the [Shift](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/shift.md) to the `Completed` status. It is possible to still capture Shift Service information whilst Quick Completing an Appointment.

## What does the Quick Complete Action include?

When Quick Completing an Shift, you are presented with a dialog showing distinct areas of input including **Shift Date & Time Information**, **Shift Service Information** as well as **Check-In/Out Location**; these areas are further described in this article.

If you wish to Quick Complete your Shift without adjusting any of these areas, you can. **Maica** will automatically populate the required ones with information from the Appointment, hence, they only need to be manually adjusted if desired.&#x20;

### Check In/Out Location

This part of the Quick Complete process captures accurate Location information. **Maica** offers the ability for Locations to be tracked to ensure that Shifts can be accurately recorded.&#x20;

In order for a Location to be obtained, the User must have Location Permissions set to Allowed on their Device or Browser.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Shift Date & Time Information&#x20;

This part of the Quick Complete process captures the relevant Date & Time information. **Maica** offers configurable capability when Quickly Completing a Shift to ensure that it can be accurately recorded.&#x20;

When Quickly Completing your Shift, **Maica** will automatically populate the Date and Time information to the scheduled Date and Time of the Shift. This can be configured by manually entering any desired Date and Time.

### Shift Services&#x20;

This part of the process offers an overview of the Shift Service(s) delivered as well as the ability to adjust the quantity of each service as required. Adjusting the quantity offers you flexibility within an Shift to control how long each Service may have been delivered. This means, if the actual Service duration is different from the scheduled Time, this can easily be captured.
