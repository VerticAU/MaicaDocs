Once clicked, you will be directed to a new Salesforce tab showing you the Shift Profile. Here, you will see a summary of the Shifts including any [Checklists](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/checklist.md), [Delivery Activities](../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/delivery-activity.md), Files and more.&#x20;

You can also open an Shift Profile directly from the [Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md), simply by clicking the `Expand Profile` button located in the bottom right corner of any Shift, as shown below.&#x20;
