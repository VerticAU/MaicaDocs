# Shift Notes

## How do I record a Shift Note(s)?

Once selected, you can create a new note by selecting the `+` button in the top right corner of the screen, as shown below.&#x20;

### 1. Attach Files&#x20;

To begin attaching a file, simply click the `Files` button at the top right corner of the Note to bring up the dialogue box. Once selected, you can attach files to the Note. This includes the ability to take a photo, attach a PDF file, or upload any other allowed file type. On a mobile device, this will also feature the option to take a photo while uploading the file.

### 2. Manage Tasks

To begin managing tasks for your Note(s), simply click the `Manage Tasks` button at the top right corner of the Participant Note to bring up the dialogue box. Once selected, you can create a new task by selecting the `+` button in the top right corner of the screen.

Once a new Participant Note Task has been created, you will be prompted to populate a number of customisable fields, including assigning your task to the required personnel.&#x20;
