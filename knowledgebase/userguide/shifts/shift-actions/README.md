# Shift Actions

## What are Shift Actions?&#x20;

Shifts actions refer to actions and tasks related to managing and handling your Shift. There are several actions you can take within an Shift in **Maica**, including the following:&#x20;

| Appointment Actions                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Check-In ](../../appointments/appointment-actions/check-in.md) | <p>Checking into Shifts sets the baseline for generating Timesheets. Whilst this is not a mandated process, it is recommended to track your care team's movements as well as actual time spent at a Shift.<br><br>If allowed by the User, Checking-In also captures the geolocation of the Shift Check-In.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Check-Out ](check-out.md)                                      | <p>Similar to Checking-In, Checking-Out of Shifts establishes the correct end point when creating Timesheets. Again, whilst this is not a mandated process, it is recommended to track your care team's movements as well as time spent. <br><br>In addition to mirroring much of the Check-In experience, when Checking-Out, you are also able to stipulate which Resource is Checking-Out and how much time has been spent on each Shift Service delivered during the Shift.<br><br>If allowed by the User, Checking-Out also captures the geolocation of the Shift Check-Out.</p> |
| [Quick Completion ](quick-complete.md)                          | Quick completing an Shift bypasses the Checking In/Out processes and sets an Shift to the `Completed` status . It is possible to still capture Shift Service information and Notes whilst doing this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Cancellation](cancellation.md)                                 | <p>The cancellation of a Shift records the reason and sets the status to <code>Cancelled</code>. The Shift is not deleted but instead is simply placed into a <code>Cancelled</code> status.<br><br>If you are cancelling a Shift within a Recurring Schedule, you can either cancel the singular Shift, or all remaining Shifts in the schedule.  </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Attach Files ](attach-files.md)                                | This provides for the ability to Attach Files to any given Shifts, including photos taken on a mobile device. These files are stored against the Salesforce Shift record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Shift Breaks](shift-breaks.md)                                 | The management of breaks that might occur during Shifts can become important and this action allows you to record any breaks taken, whether billable or not during any given Shift.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Shift Expenses](shift-expenses.md)                             | Shift Expenses allows you to add Expense records against a Resource that may occur during a Shift, such as having to pay a for a Parking Spot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [Checklists](checklists.md)                                     | Checklists allow you to complete a set of pre-defined tasks that have been set (via Maica Checklists) for each Shift Service delivered during a Shift.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## How do I access the Shift Actions?&#x20;

In order to begin actioning a Shift, simply click on the Shift in your [Planner](../../the-planner/planner-overview.md), then click the `View` button. Once the Shift is showing, the available Shift Actions (depending on your Shift Status), will be visible on the bottom of the window, other than the `Open Appointment Profile` and `Google Maps` actions, which are located in the top right corner, as shown below.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/shift actions.png" alt="" width="380"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Some Actions are also available from the Shift Quick Information dialog, as shown below. The Quick Information Actions are accessible simply by clicking the Shift and without having to open the entire module.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
These Actions are configurable in the [Planner Management](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9selzjEx6KX7RYEawAVr/settings/planner-management) Settings.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Shift Actions Visibility based on Shift Status

The visibility of the Shift Actions are dependant on the **Status** of the **Shift**. Please refer to the table below to learn which action is available for each Shift Status.

| Shift Status                  | Available Actions                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Scheduled` (Pre Check-In)    | <p>Check-In <br>Quick Completion <br>Cancellation <br>Attach Files <br>Participant Notes <br>Open Shift Profile<br>Google Maps</p> |
| `In Progress` (Post Check-In) | <p>Check-Out <br>Cancellation <br>Attach Files <br>Participant Notes <br>Open Shift Profile<br>Google Maps</p>                     |
| `Completed` (Post Check-Out)  | <p>Participant Notes<br>Open Shift Profile<br>Google Maps</p>                                                                      |

{% hint style="info" %}
Shift Actions visibility for Resource are also dependant on Resource Status. To learn more about Shift Resource Status & Actions Visibility based on Resource Status, please [click here](../../appointments/appointment-actions/#appointment-resource-status-and-actions-visibility-based-on-resource-status). Please note, it works the same way in Maica for Shifts as it does for Appointments.&#x20;
