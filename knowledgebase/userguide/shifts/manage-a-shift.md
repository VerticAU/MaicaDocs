# Manage a Shift

## How do I manage a Shift in Maica?

Once a [Shift](../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/shift.md) has been [created](../appointments/create-an-appointment/), you may want to change some of the details, such as the Resource(s) or Checklist(s) applicable to the Shift. All this can be done via the Manage Shift processes outlined in this article.

In order to begin Managing a Shift, simply click on the Shift in your Planner. To then manage the fields, click the `edit` button in the bottom right corner of the Manage Shift screen, as shown below.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Until you click this button, all fields will be `read-only`.
{% endhint %}

## Which Shift sections can I manage?

Once editing, you are able to manage the following sections:&#x20;

### [Basic Details](create-a-shift/basic-details.md)

In this section you can manage the [Resource(s)](../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/resource.md) and [Asset(s)](../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/asset.md) allocated to your selected Shift. Similarly to [Creating a Shift](create-a-shift/), you can do this by simply typing the name of a Resource or Asset (or multiple), or by clicking on the `Filter` icon which allows for [Smart Selection](../appointments/create-an-appointment/smart-selection-filter.md) of any of the above mentioned.&#x20;

You can also adjust Date & Time Information.&#x20;

### Shift Services

This section allows you to manage your existing Shift Service(s) as well as add new Shift Service(s) if needed.

The following fields are manageable:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/manage shift services.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<table><thead><tr><th width="133">Number</th><th>Detail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Click this button to add additional Shift Service(s).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Change the quantity of a Shift Service to control how long each Service may be delivered within a Shift. The quantity of an Shift Service is further explained <a href="../appointments/create-an-appointment/summary.md#id-1.-adjusted-quantity">here</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>This number outlines the number of Shift Service(s) that are connected to your Shift. </td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Click this button to mark this Shift Service as cancelled, this will exclude this Service from your Shift. After this button has been selected, you can reselect it to add the Service back if desired.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### [Location](create-a-shift/location.md)

This section enables the editing of the Location at which the [Shift](../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/shift.md) is being held through a lookup to all your stored Locations.

You can also manage the associated Accomodations at this stage.&#x20;

### [Additional Details](create-a-shift/additional-details.md)&#x20;

The focus of this section is to edit the [Checklist(s)](../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/checklist.md) applicable to this Shift. You can do so through a Checklist lookup.&#x20;

### [Shift Instructions](create-a-shift/shift-instructions.md)

The focus of this section is to edit the Instructions associated with this Shift. You can do so through a text input.&#x20;

### [Custom Fields](create-a-shift/custom-fields.md)&#x20;

The Custom Fields tab captures any information from Custom Fields that have been added to your Organisations Appointment profile beyond what **Maica** offers. This section allows for the management of already added fields, **not** the addition of new fields.&#x20;

### [Recurring Schedule](../appointments/create-an-appointment/schedule.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
To learn about creating a Recurring Schedule for a Shift, please click [here](create-a-shift/schedule.md).
{% endhint %}

When editing a Recurring Schedule, you have two options.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, when a Shift is part of a Recurring Schedule, the drag and drop functionality will be prevented.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### 1. Edit the `Master Shift`

The Master Shift in a series of Recurring Shift is seen to be the blueprint of what will be created in future Shifts, and is the initial Shift created. It includes all details for the Shift, such as Resource(s), Location, Date & Time Information, etc. This means that any modifications made to the Master Shift will affect all subsequent Recurring Shifts generated, thus adjustments should be carefully examined.

You can identify a Master Shift in Maica by the following icon and tooltip:&#x20;

If you edit the Master Shift, **Maica** will prompt you to confirm that you would like to apply changes to all future Shifts, as shown below.

#### E**dit a `Subsequent` Shift**

Editing any subsequent Shift within a series of Recurring Shifts gives you the option to either apply changes to just the Shifts being edited or to all future Shifts. Again, Maica will prompt you to confirm which option you would like to apply the changes to, as shown below.



<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/random recurring appointment.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
If you select to apply changes only to the **Shift** being edited only, then Maica will remove this **Shift** from the Recurring Schedule and effectively turn this **Shift** into a single **Shift** with all changes reflected.
{% endhint %}

## Saving your Shift

Once you have made the changes, either click the `Tick` icon to confirm your changes and update your Appointment, or the `Undo` icon on the bottom left of the screen to cancel your changes.
