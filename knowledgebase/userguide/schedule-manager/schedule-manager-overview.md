# Schedule Manager Overview

## What is the Schedule Manager?&#x20;

In **Maica**, the Schedule Manager is a dedicated tool for managing [Appointments](/broken/pages/qWrsJvyquHTBgREf1QDj) and [Shifts](/broken/pages/zNYLCCfkOlI0IqQ3sOvl) in a data table view.&#x20;

It functions in a similar way to the [Planner](../the-planner/planner-overview.md), offering the same filters and tools, but in a list-style layout with additional bulk actions. This enables you to view and manage hundreds of records at once, configure which fields are displayed, and perform bulk actions such as status changes, cancellations, quick completes and resource allocations.

## Schedule Manager Function Overview

As mentioned, the Schedule Manager is designed to bring the full functionality of the Planner into a flexible, Excel-like table view. You can:

* Apply the same [Filters](../the-planner/planner-filter/) available in the Planner to refine your list.
* Configure which columns are displayed, including custom fields.
* Perform bulk actions such as Quick Completes, Cancellation, Status Changes, and Resource Allocation.
* Access individual Appointment Actions through the row-level menu.

## Schedule Manager Components

The Schedule Manager includes several components located in the top toolbar and row level. These are outlined below:
