# NDIS Agreements

## What is a NDIS Service Agreement?&#x20;

`NDIS Service Agreements` are the financial construct in which your Participant(s) receive Services. In **Maica**, these Agreements are designed specifically to support the funding structure of the NDIS, ensuring that they are perfectly tailored to support your Participants.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
These Service Agreements also support other funding structures, such as **HCP** and **CHSP**.
{% endhint %}

In order to setup a [Service Agreement](../../../getting-started/maica-key-concepts/service-agreement.md) with the right components required to be compliant with the NDIS funding structure, simply select your `Funding Type` as one of the following:&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="212">Funding Type </th><th>Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>Agency Managed</code></td><td>Funds are managed by the NDIS or a government agency, paying service providers directly.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Plan Managed</code></td><td>A plan manager handles the funds on behalf of the participant, overseeing payments and budgeting.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Self Managed</code></td><td>The participant controls and manages their own funds, choosing and paying providers directly.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Combination</code> </td><td>A mix of funding types where different parts of the participant's plan may be managed by different entities. Here, you can add different Support Item and Support Categories with different funding types within one Service Agreement. </td></tr><tr><td><code>Other</code></td><td>Any alternative funding arrangements that don't fall under the typical categories listed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Once you have selected your Funding Type, **Maica** will dynamically update your Service Agreement record and display the relevant components needed to populate your Agreement with [Agreement Items](../../the-building-blocks.md#agreement-items). For an NDIS Service Agreement, this is all done through one Quick Action, which is the [Manage Service Agreement](manage-service-agreement.md) button.&#x20;

## Key Components&#x20;

However, outside of the above mentioned Quick Action, an NDIS Service Agreement has several important components and details; for additional information on each one, please see below.

### Information Tab&#x20;

On the left hand side of your Agreement you will notice an Information Tab which contains crucial details for your Agreement, including the following key fields:&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="253">Field </th><th>Description </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>Price List</code></td><td>This refers to the associated Price List that you link to your Service Agreement in order to control pricing. <br><br>This <strong>can</strong> be modified at any time during the term of the Agreement, and <strong>Maica</strong> will keep track of it in the <code>Agreement History</code> as well as the <code>Previous Price Book</code> and <code>Last Price Book Change</code> fields in the Information Tab.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Funding Type</code></td><td>This refers to selected Funding Type for the Service Agreement. For all Aged Care Service Agreements, this will be <code>Home Care Package</code>. </td></tr><tr><td><code>Status</code></td><td>This refers to the current <code>Status</code> of the Service Agreement. To learn more about how the Status is determined within <strong>Maica</strong>, click <a href="../#service-agreement-statuses">here</a>. </td></tr><tr><td><code>Total Items</code></td><td>This refers to the total number of Agreement Items within the Service Agreement. To learn more about how Agreement Items are configured, click <a href="../aged-care-agreements/manage-services.md">here</a>. </td></tr><tr><td><code>Total Allocated</code></td><td>This refers to the total amount of allotted funds across all associated Agreement Items.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Total Expenditure</code></td><td>This refers to the total amount of spent funds across all associated Agreement Items.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Utilisation</code> </td><td>This is a percentage calculated based on the Total Expenditure against the Total Allocated in order to represent how much of the Participants Funding has been spent. </td></tr><tr><td><code>Autorise Stripe Auto Billing</code></td><td>Indicates if the Participant authorises automatic billing through Stripe for this Service Agreement.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Start &#x26; End Date</code></td><td>This represents the beginning and ending of the Agreement period. </td></tr></tbody></table>

### Service Agreement Leave&#x20;

The Service Agreement Leave component provides the ability to be able to place a Service Agreement on leave according to the four types of leave that are configurable and acceptable according to the Government Legislation.

In order to learn how to set up a Service Agreement Leave Record, click [here](../#service-agreement-leave).&#x20;

### Agreement Items&#x20;

The Agreement Items component provides the ability to view each [Agreement Item](../../the-building-blocks.md#agreement-items) as an individual record. [Agreement Items](../../the-building-blocks.md#agreement-items) are configured and added to an Agreement through the [Manage Service Agreement](manage-service-agreement.md) Quick Action.&#x20;
