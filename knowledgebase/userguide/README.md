# Welcome to the Maica User Guide

## Who are we?

We are an innovative **NDIS** and **Aged Care** software designed for providers. We help providers streamline operations, enhance care delivery, and boost efficiency with our comprehensive digital healthcare solutions built on the Salesforce platform.

Through the power of software, we want to enable providers to best **manage their clients** as **effectively** and as **efficiently** as possible.&#x20;

Offering all the benefits of Salesforce's security, reliability, and scalability, we provide seamless data management, comprehensive reporting, and powerful automation. With access to Salesforce's extensive ecosystem, **Maica** users can optimise their operations and deliver superior care using industry-leading technology.

## How is our Knowledge Base structured?&#x20;

Our Knowledge Base is divided into two main sections:&#x20;

* **The User Guide**
* **The Administration Guide**.&#x20;

This structure is designed to meet the needs of different types of users within the organisation. The **User Guide** provides easy-to-follow instructions for everyday users who work with the application, while the **Administration Guide** offers more technical information for administrators and power users responsible for configuring and maintaining the system. This setup ensures that each user can quickly access relevant resources based on their role and responsibilities.&#x20;

In order to switch between the two guides, simply use the dropdown in the top left corner of your screen.&#x20;

## User Guide Overview&#x20;

The **User Guide** is designed for non-technical, everyday users of **Maica**. It contains practical information on how to use the application for tasks such as managing Participants, Scheduling Appointments & Shifts, creating Service Agreements, and navigating the Planner. This guide is ideal for staff members who need step-by-step instructions for using **Maica** in their daily work. If you're looking for how-to guides, tips for common tasks, or general feature overviews, the User Guide is the place to start.
